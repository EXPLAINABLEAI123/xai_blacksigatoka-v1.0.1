![App Logo](/app/src/main/res/drawable/xai_logo1.png)

Welcome to the Black Sigatoka Detection mobile application! This application is built using Java and Android to provide a user-friendly interface for detecting the presence of black sigatoka disease in banana plants. The app leverages a machine learning model to analyze images of banana leaves and identify whether they are affected by the disease.

## Features

- Capture or upload images of banana leaves.
- Process the images using the deployed machine learning model.
- Obtain instant results indicating the presence of black sigatoka disease.
- View detailed information about the disease and its effects on banana plants.
- Save and share the results with others.
